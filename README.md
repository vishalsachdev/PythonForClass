## Python for Class

A 'How to ' Guide for using python for class. Includes an overview of common tools to run python/jupyter on your computer and on the cloud. This is prepared for teachers interested in using the tools for teaching and not for production /deployment. I will also cover options for integrating with LMS , directed at teachers outside the CS domain. I teach in the GIES College of business at UIUC and am preparing this for faculty here.
